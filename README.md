# PythonFinal
Final Project for Python Course

Note: To run this program, the following libraries must first be installed:
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
scikit-survival
tensorflow

An older version of Tensorflow must be used. I used version 1.3.1 because the 
API was changed in an update and due to this, will not work with the code. 

Once the needed libraries are installed and have been selected in your
current environment in Anaconda Navigator, launch Jupyter notebook 
through Anaconda and it will be able to run with no issues.
